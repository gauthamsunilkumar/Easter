        <h3 style="color: #9f0080;">Why is Easter is a big holliday?</h3>


        <p style="color: #9f0080;">Easter Sunday is one of the most festive events among Christians worldwide. It commemorates Jesus Christ's resurrection from death, as written in the Christian bible. Easter Sunday commemorates Jesus' resurrection from death.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #904309;">What does Easter Mean?</h3>

        <p style="color: #904309;">Given the symbolism of new life and rebirth, it was only natural to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus at this time of the year. The naming of the celebration as “Easter” seems to go back to the name of a pre-Christian goddess in England, Eostre, who was celebrated at beginning of spring.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #F9F7D9;">What is the story of Easter?</h3>

        <p style="color: #F9F7D9;">On Good Friday, Jesus Christ was executed by crucifixion. His body was taken down from the cross, and buried in a cave. The tomb was guarded and an enormous stone was put over the entrance, so that no-one could steal the body.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #CFFFFE;">Why do we have Easter eggs?</h3>

        <p style="color: #CFFFFE;">Eggs represent new life and rebirth, and it's thought that this ancient custom became a part of Easter celebrations. In the medieval period, eating eggs was forbidden during Lent (the 40 days before Easter) so on Easter Sunday, tucking into an egg was a real treat!</p>
