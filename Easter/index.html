        <h3 style="color: #F9F7D9;">Where did Easter Originate</h3>
        <p style="color: #F9F7D9;">The naming of the celebration as “Easter” seems to go back to the name of a pre-Christian goddess in England, Eostre, who was celebrated at beginning of spring. The only reference to this goddess comes from the writings of the Venerable Bede, a British monk who lived in the late seventh and early eighth century.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #CFFFFE;">Why is Easter important</h3>
        <p style="color: #CFFFFE">The resurrection of Jesus, as described in the New Testament of the Bible, is essentially the foundation upon which the Christian religions are built. Hence, Easter is a very significant date on the Christian calendar.</p>
